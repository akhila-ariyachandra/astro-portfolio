title: "My Prettier Configuration"
description: "The Prettier Configuration I use for all my projects"
---

This is the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) Configuration I got when this site was created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) around 2019 and I've stuck with it since then.

```json:.prettierrc.json
{
    "endOfLine": "lf",
    "semi": true,
    "singleQuote": false,
    "tabWidth": 2,
    "trailingComma": "es5"
}
```
