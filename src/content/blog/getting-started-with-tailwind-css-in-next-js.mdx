[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is an awesome CSS framework. It gives us enough styling options without being too opinionated. Lately I've being using it along with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). In this post I'll show how to setup a Next.js project with Tailwind CSS.

## Setting up the Next.js project

Start with initializing a project.

```bash
yarn init --yes
```

Then install the React and Next.js dependencies.

```bash
yarn add react react-dom next
```

Next add the following scripts in `package.json`.

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

After that let's create a layout component to wrap all our components in all the pages. Create the `src` folder. In it create another folder called `components` and in it create `Layout.js`.

```jsx:src/components/Layout.js
const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Layout;
```

Next let's create the index page in out application. In the project root create the `pages` folder and in it create `index.js`.

```jsx:pages/index.js
import Layout from "../src/components/Layout";

const Index = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>Next.js Tailwind CSS starter</h1>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default Index;
```

To start the development server just run the `dev` script.

```bash
yarn dev
```

When you [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser you see the following.

  )}
  alt="Next.js Project"
/>

## Adding Tailwind CSS

First install Tailwind CSS as a dev dependency.

```bash
yarn add tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer -D
```

Next we need to create the Tailwind the config file. We can create a minimal config file with the following command.

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Since Tailwind CSS has thousands of CSS classes the CSS file will end up very big.

<PostImage
  src={import(
    "@/public/blog/getting-started-with-tailwind-css-in-next-js/tailwind_size.png"
  )}
  alt="Tailwind CSS size"
/>

Since we will will rarely use the all classes, we should specify which classes to include the final CSS file. Fortunately Tailwind CSS has a built in [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) tool which can be used to remove all unused classes.

In the `tailwind.config.js` add all the React component files in the `purge` property. In our case we will add all files in the `pages` and `components` folders.

```javascript:tailwind.config.js {2}
module.exports = {
  purge: ["./pages/**/*.js", "./src/components/**/*.js"],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Since Tailwind CSS generates a lot of classes by default, running the application in development mode can be quite slow especially when trying to use DevTools.

To help with this we can use the [Just-in-Time Mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode). To enable it we just need to add it to the `tailwind.config.js` file.

```javascript:tailwind.config.js {2}
module.exports = {
  mode: "jit",
  purge: ["./pages/**/*.js", "./src/components/**/*.js"],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Finally we need to import Tailwind CSS to our application. In Next.js we have to do it in the `_app.js` file.

Create the `_app.js` file in the `pages` folder and directly import the CSS file.

```jsx:pages/_app.js
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css'

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
};

export default MyApp;
```

## Conclusion

That's all you need to do to start using Tailwind CSS in your Next.js project. You can style your components by adding the classes in the `className` prop.

For example, we can style the title in the index page like this.

```jsx:pages/index.js {6}
import Layout from "../src/components/Layout";

const Index = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1 className="text-6xl font-semibold italic">
        Next.js Tailwind CSS starter
      </h1>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default Index;
```

  )}
  alt="Title styling"
/>

We can center all the content by adding some classes to the `Layout` component.

```jsx:pages/index.js {4}
const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <main className="container mx-auto">{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Layout;
```
